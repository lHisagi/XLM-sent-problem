# XLM-sent-problem
 I made a mistake at the time of sending a Lumens obtained from the Keybase Airdrop. At the time of filling out the data, I did not place the IP Memo where it corresponded and for this reason the cryptocurrency was not sent.  Is there a way to reverse the operation and have the lumens go back to my Keybase wallet?
